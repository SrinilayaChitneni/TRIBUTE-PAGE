            <h2>Biography</h2>
<p id="legend">It is said wicket keeping is the busiest port in the river of Cricket.
Indeed, Wicket keeper is the busiest person on the cricket field. Taking stance behind the wicket, near or behind depends on the pace at which the ball is bowled. Bending down before every delivery jumping high, diving forward or sideways and even in front of wicket to claim a bat -pad catch is expected from a keeper. Innovation of fielding placement further demanded keeper to dash across half of the ground to take a catch or to save a run.<br>
Mahendra Singh Dhoni, the former captain of the Indian Cricket Team in all three formats announced his retirement from international cricket as a shocking surprise to his fans on 15 August 2020 India's 74th Independence Day.Dhoni posted a video on Instagram that contained pictures from both the best and the worst moments of his career with song ‘Mai Pal do Pal ka shayar hoon’ playing in the background. The video was captioned as "Thanks a lot for ur love and support throughout, from 19:29 hrs consider me as Retired".
This unique way of declaring the retirement placed a full stop on all sorts of speculation about his retirement.
Dhoni story began on July 7 1981, when a boy was born in Ranchi, Bihar (now Jharkhand). His father Pan Singh worked in junior management positions in a Corporation. He studied at DAV Jawahar Vidya Mandir, Ranchi, where he initially excelled in badminton and football and was selected at district and club level in these sports.
Dhoni was a goalkeeper for his football team and was sent to play cricket for a local cricket club by his football coach as a wicket keeper.
No one expected a boy who played football as a goalkeeper would become a star in the cricketing world. Dhoni impressed many people with his wicket keeping His cricketing skills were impressive and he soon became the regular wicketkeeper at the Commando Cricket Club.
In 1997-98 season season Dhoni was picked up for Vinoo Mankad Trophy Under-16 Championship where he performed well.From then, there was no looking back. After graduation, being an excellent sportsperson he was appointed as a TTE by the railways at Kharagpur from 2001-2003.
Dhoni had a mischievous side too. He and his friends covered themselves in white bed sheets and walked around in their complex late at night pretending to be ghosts to scare the guards.
Dhoni, informally known as Mahi, is a fan of Adam Gilchrist,. His childhood idols were Sachin Tendulkar, Bollywood actor Amitabh Bachchan and Nightingale of Bollywood Lata Mangeshkar.
Later on Dhoni was fortunate to play along with his childhood idol and legend Sachin Tendulkar with the Indian Cricket Team.
In his early career Dhoni scored a half century in his debut match at the Bihar Cricket Team scoring 68 not-out in the second innings against Assam. He scored his first century while playing against Bengal in 2000-2001 season. He scored five fifties in four Ranji matches.
His lower order hard hitting style came into limelight when he performed well for the Jharkhand Cricket Team.Dhoni's talent was discovered by the BCCI's small-town talent-spotting initiative TRDW [Talent Research Development Wingof BCCI].One ex-captain of Rajasthan Ranji Team also praised Dhoni during a discussion with me at Jaipur in 2002 and predicted that the hard hitting boy would be next batting star for the Indian Cricket Team.
Dhoni’s talent was recognised nationally in the 2003/04 season, as he was picked for the India A squad for a tour of Zimbabwe and Kenya.In his fifth one-day international, Dhoni scored 148 at Visakhapatnam off only 123 deliveries. Dhoni's 148 a new record for the highest score by an Indian wicket-keeper.
His 183 not-out against Sri Lanka in 2005 is the highest score by a wicket-keeper. Dhoni has the most stumpings (120) by any wicket-keeper in an ODI career and is so far the only keeper to pass 100 stumpings.</p>

<p id="legend">It is a fact that Dhoni’s performance with bat was the main reason for Skipper Ganguly and selector More to prefer him over more skillful keepers. He was selected to play in Deodhar Trophy in 2004 and his towering sixes earned him India cap. He invented the famous Helicopter shot that was to hit out even yorkers for runs.<br>
 A safe delivery was no more safe!<br>
Dhoni grabbed his opportunity with both hands. He shone as a batsman, playing attacking cricket; He became excellent finisher in one day games. Spectators loved his brand of cricket and that made him the darling of crowd. With Dhoni having made a mark in the India A squad, he was naturally picked for the Indian ODI squad for the Bangladesh tour in 2004/05.
Dhoni did not have a great start to his ODI career, getting run out for a duck on debut. In spite of an average series against Bangladesh, Dhoni was picked again for the Pakistan ODI series.
In the second match of the series Dhoni's 148 surpassed the earlier record for the highest score by an Indian wicket-keeper, a record that he would go on to re-write before the end of the year.
India had returned home losing to Bangladesh and Sri Lanka in World cup in West Indies in 2007. The sentimental Indian fans were aghast that their heroes had failed to qualify for the next round.
The fans took to burning the effigies of cricketers on the streets and vandalized. The media wrote the obituary of Indian cricket. The sponsors cancelled their contracts!
<br>

BCCI reacted to the loss as expected. The stalwarts like Tendulkar, Ganguly and Dravid opted out for first T20 World Cup in South Africa in 2007. A young team was selected and Dhoni became the skipper.<br>
The fortune favors the brave! The adage is a perfect hat that fits Dhoni.<br>

ICC world cup began in a dicey manner. In the group match, India’s match against Scotland was rained out. Both the teams shared a point. India played the second match against Pakistan that ended up in tie. Pakistan was in command but faltered in the end. The match was decided on the basis of bowling at the stump. Pakistani bowler failed to hit the stump and match was won by India. India qualified in super 8. India defeated Pakistan in final as Pakistan faltered once again. India won t20 world cup. Dhoni had arrived.
Dhoni was chosen to lead India in first-ever World T20 in 2007. India won that Trophy with a victory over arch-rivals Pakistan in an intensely fought final on 24 September 2007.
Dhoni then became the second Indian captain to have won a World Cup in any form of cricket, after Kapil Dev.</p><br>

<p id="legend"> Ravi Shastri's fervent commentary from the 2011 World Cup final - "Dhoni finishes it off in style,India lifts the World Cup after 28 years" - continues to echo in the minds of Indian cricket enthusiasts. Dhoni's iconic six over mid-on against SriLanka's Nuwan Kulasekara, which clinched the victory for India at a packed Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, concluded a nearly three-decade wait for the trophy and provided over a billion Indians with an extraordinary reason to rejoice.
<br>    
April 2nd, 2011 marks a historic day for Indian cricket as the national team clinched the ICC Cricket World Cup after a 28-year hiatus, reminiscent of their unexpected triumph in 1983. This victory stands as the pinnacle of Indian cricket in the 21st century, etched into the collective memory of every Indian. Moments like Ravi Shastri's exhilarating commentary, "Dhoni finishes off in style," the triumphant lap of honor for Sachin Tendulkar, and the commemorative site at Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium where Dhoni's winning six landed, have immortalized this triumph.</p>

<p id="legend">MS Dhoni emerged as India's talismanic leader, guiding the team to success with his Midas touch. Following the disappointment of the 2007 50-over World Cup, where India suffered early elimination, Dhoni assumed the mantle of leadership. Despite securing India's first world title in 24 years at the ICC T20 World Cup in 2007, there was a lingering sense of unfinished business. While T20 cricket gained prominence, the thirst for the ultimate prize, the 50-over World Cup, remained unquenched.
The 2011 World Cup, hosted by India, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka, presented a golden opportunity for India to reclaim cricket's most coveted trophy. India and Sri Lanka progressed to the semi-finals after defeating Pakistan and New Zealand respectively.
The final showdown took place at Mumbai's iconic Wankhede Stadium, a venue laden with significance for Indian cricket. Sachin Tendulkar, the Mumbai native who had endured the heartbreak of the 2003 World Cup loss, now had a chance to fulfill his dream in his sixth attempt.<br>
Under Dhoni's captaincy, India won the 2011 ICC World Cup. In the final against Sri Lanka, chasing 275, Dhoni promoted himself up the batting order, coming before an in-form Yuvraj Singh.
When he came to bat, India needed more than six runs per over with three top-order batsmen already dismissed. His last ball six will remain dear in our hearts and minds forever.</p><br>

<p id="legend">"God Isn't Coming To Save You...": MSD Champions Trophy <br>
On a gloomy and rainy evening at the Edgbaston Cricket Ground in Birmingham, the men in blue basked in glory.Batting first, India managed to score 129 runs for the loss of seven wickets as the match was reduced to 20 overs per side. Virat Kohli was the top-scorer with his 43-run knock. Ishant Sharma, the most-expensive bowler on that day, managed to pick the crucial wickets of Rav Bopara and Eoin Morgan, who were once cruising in the chase. R Ashwin was handed over the responsibility to defend 14 runs in the last over. James Tredwell was beaten by his spin on the last ball and Dhoni jumped in joy as he collected the ball. In a thrilling and rain-marred final, India defeated the hosts England by 5 runs to win the Champions Trophy 2013. On 23rd June 2013, the Indian cricket team led by MS Dhoni completed a memorable fightback against England in the final of the ICC Champions Trophy to win the coveted tournament for the second time in its history. The victory was also memorable as MS Dhoni scripted history as he became the first captain to have won all the ICC trophies. He remains the only international captain to have won the ICC T20 World Cup (2007), the ICC World Cup (2011) and the ICC Champions Trophy (2013).</p><br>

<p id="legend">Under Dhoni’s captaincy, India topped the Test cricket rankings for the first time, in 2009. He is the most successful Indian Test captain with 27 Test wins, eclipsing Saurav Ganguly's record of 21.
Dhoni is the first Indian wicket-keeper to complete 4,000 Test runs. Dhoni's 224 against Australia in Chennai is the third highest score by an Indian captain. His mighty strokes included his own designed Helicopter Shot that went way beyond the boundary line for big sixes.</p><br>

<p id="legend">
For the 2015 World Cup held in Australia and New Zealand, Dhoni was named the captain of the 30-member squad by the BCCI in December 2014. Under his captaincy, India reached the semi-finals with ease, beating Bangladesh in the quarter-finals.  At the time of the birth of his daughter, Dhoni was in Australia as the captain of Indian team with 2015 Cricket World Cup. He decided not to travel back to India and was famously quoted saying that "I am on national duty, other things can wait."</p><br>

<p id="legend">MS Dhoni led India to three ICC titles but he is nearly as famous for his exploits in the yellow of Chennai Super Kings in the Indian Premier League.
Dhoni, known as CSK's "Thala" (leader), captained the franchise to ten finals in their first 14 IPL seasons and won them five titles - in 2010, 2011, 2018, 2021 and 2023 . He's led them to the playoffs in 12 editions, making them the most consistent team in the IPL. 
He has also led Chennai to two Champions League T20 titles in 2010 and 2014.<br>
Dhoni was bought by Chennai Super Kings for US$1.5 million at the first IPL auction in 2008 and has been their captain ever since. No other player has led an IPL team for so long.
Dhoni's most memorable season with the bat was 2018, when he scored 455 runs at an average of 75.83 and strike rate of 150.66 to lead CSK to the title in their comeback season following the ban.
Dhoni was the first to play 250 matches in the IPL, reaching the milestone in 2023, four years after he played his last international game for India. He had resigned as CSK captain ahead of IPL 2022, but took back the captaincy after his successor Ravindra Jadeja stepped down mid-way through the season. He led the team to the title in 2023, before stepping down from captaincy again next year.</p><br>

Dhoni has not only been a star in the cricketing world but has also been recipient of multiple national honours such as Padma Shri (2009), Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna Award (2007-08) and Padma Bhushan (2018).<br>

<p id="legend">
Forgetting Team India’s shocking defeat at the hands of New Zealand in the 2019 World Cup semi-final isn’t easy for forget for a cricket fan. A rain-curtailed affair that kept the viewers on the edge of their seats for a couple of days, only to give them a massive heartbreak. The chase of 240 turned trickier after the scorecard read 5 for 3 in 3.1 overs, further deteriorating to 92 for 6. A 116-run partnership between, MS Dhoni and Ravindra Jadeja, for the 7th wicket, gave a little hope to the fans but the tables turned in the last three overs with Jadeja’s dismissal followed by Dhoni’s run-out.   
<br> While he was there, there was still hope. When he fell, well we knew it was over.
Yes, we are referring to MS Dhoni's run out vs New Zealand in the World Cup
semifinal, which pretty much was the last nail in the Men in Blue's coffin.
Needing 25 from 10, Dhoni took a single and turned for a 2nd run, the first run gave
his his fifty, the second one was needed to ensure that he had made it to retain the
strike. That's where he fell short.</p><br>
<div class="image-container"><img src=" https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/292000/292060.6.jpg "></div>
<p id="legend">Dhoni was out with 3 cm to spare and the last hope that we had after Ravindra Jadeja's departure, was gone. India lost by 18 runs,but the sight which really broke our hearts was that Dhoni weeping as he left the field.
He had taken us over the line in countless matches. But today he fell short. He knew
as he walked off that India were out of the World Cup, he would never play another
World Cup match and it was an end of an era in many ways. For us, his fans,the
sight was simply heartbreaking. Why? Because the same realisations dawned on us
too. Plus the fact that Captain Cool was human too, he had emotion too.
The end of his international career has left a void in the cricketing world and he would always be in the memory of cricket lovers as Captain Cool.
